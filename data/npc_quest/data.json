    "quest": "My dear friend, I require your aid on a matter of great importance. I have sensed a disturbance in the balance of magic, and fear that a powerful dark force is at work. I ask that you journey to the mountains of Angmar and investigate this matter. Be wary, for danger lurks within those ancient halls. May the Valar guide your steps.",
    "dialogue": "Option 1: Accept the quest\n\nPlayer: I am honored that you would trust me with such a task. I will journey to the mountains of Angmar and investigate this disturbance. May the Valar guide my steps.\n\nFriend: Thank you, my friend. I have faith in your abilities. Take this map to guide you on your journey. Remember to be cautious, for the mountain ruins are dangerous.\n\nOption 2: Decline the quest\n\nPlayer: I'm sorry, my friend, but I cannot accept this quest. I am not skilled enough to handle such a dangerous mission.\n\nFriend: I understand, my friend. There is no shame in knowing your limits. Perhaps there is another way you can aid me in my search for the dark force.\n\nOption 3: Ask for more information\n\nPlayer: Before I accept this quest, I must know more. What kind of disturbance have you sensed, and how do you know it is a dark force?\n\nFriend: I have sensed a disruption in the flow of magic, as though something is attempting to manipulate it. I fear it could be a powerful dark wizard seeking to gain control. The mountains of Angmar are known to be a place where dark magic was once practiced, so it is a likely place for such a force to be at work.\n\nOption 4: Negotiate for a reward\n\nPlayer: I would be happy to help you with this quest, but I must ask for a reward in return for my services.\n\nFriend: I understand your desire for compensation, but this is a matter of great importance. If this dark force is left unchecked, it could bring about great harm to the world of magic. Can I count on you to help me without the promise of a reward?\n\nPlayer: Yes, I understand the gravity of the situation. I will journey to the mountains of Angmar and investigate the disturbance.",
